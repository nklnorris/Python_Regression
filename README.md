# Linear Regression in Python

### Introduction

These exercises were uploaded to demonstrate linear regression and multiple linear regression models in Python. The analyses use the following:

* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn

### Description

Both exercises use WHO life expectancy data to predict life expectancy. Each exercise has the following sections:

* Load and investigate the data
* Split data into a test and training set
* Create model using training set
* Use model to predict life expectancy of test data set
* Evalate the algorithm's fit

The linear regression predicts adult life expectancy based on infant mortality whereas the multiple linear regression predicts adult life expectancy from numerous independent variables.
